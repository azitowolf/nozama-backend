- user sign up:form with required info > first and last name, shipping address, email address, billing address...
- wait when do we add a credit card? Stripe will take that info, we store only the card token. Actually Max told me that by integrating Stripe with Express we only care about one-time charges. So users will enter the card number every time….need to think this step better.

- users enters card and pays. He will receive an email notification with the order confirmation/invoice, order number, items.
